# statistical-model-implementer
<br>
<br>
A library (if I do push it to pypi) that takes in training and test datasets and then applies statistical models, calculates metrics and also gives the best performing model.


### Example: Using the Winconsin Cancer data that I had analysed earlier. 
<br><br>
The train and test set are used as inputs for running the Implementer.
<br>
<br>
### Models Used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Support Vector Classifier
4. K Neighbors Classifier
5. Random Forest Classifier
6. Adaboost Classifier

### Metrics used:
1. Classification Report
2. Accuracy Score
3. Confusion Matrix
<br>
All other metrics that take y_test and predicted Y value as input.

### To Implement:
1. KNN algorithm: need a way to find the optimal K value and then use that as the k_neighbors value
2. Add a way for the user to add the random state and other input parameters for the Statistical models
3. Keep on adding to this list.
