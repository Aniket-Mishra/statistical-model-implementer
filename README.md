# statistical-model-implementer
<br>
<br>
A library (if I do push it to pypi) that takes in training and test datasets and then applies statistical models, calculates metrics and also gives the best performing model.


### Example: Using the Winconsin Cancer data that I had analysed earlier. 
<br><br>
The train and test set are used as inputs for running the Implementer.

2.  Classification
<br>

### Models Used
#### Regression
1. Linear Regression (sklearn)
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Support Vector Regression
4. Random Forest Regressor
5. AdaBoost Regressor

#### Classification
1. Logistic Regression (bivariate only)
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Support Vector Classifier
4. KNN Classifier
5. AdaBoost Classifier
6. RandomForest Classigier

### Metrics used:

2. Accuracy Score
3. Confusion Matrix
4. F1 Score
<br>
All other metrics that take y_test and predicted Y value as input.
